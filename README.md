How to Play: The gameplay is the same as regular Yahtzee, but there is no possibility of an Upper Section Bonus or Yahtzee Bonus.
You can click on a die in your current set to lock it for the next roll. The game will automatically switch between Player 1 and Player 2. To attempt a move, click on the applicable upper section die, or click anywhere inside the applicable lower section box. If the move applies to your set of dice, you will receive those points. Otherwise, you will receive a zero and cannot try again.
